====================

GENERAL GUIDELINES
------------------
1. **Submit an Issue First**:  
   Before working on a major change or new feature, please open an issue in the repository.  
   This allows us to discuss the idea and agree on the best approach before significant work begins.

2. **Fork and Clone**:
   - Fork the repository on GitHub.
   - Clone your fork locally for development.

3. **Code Style**:  
   Follow established code conventions. Adhere to the project's formatting and naming standards.  
   Consistency with indentation, spacing, and documentation style is key for readability.

4. **Commit Messages**:  
   Write clear, descriptive commit messages. Include the issue reference in the message if applicable.  
   Format: "MODULE: Brief description of the change"

5. **Testing**:  
   All code contributions must be tested. Include relevant tests in the `/tests` directory,  
   and ensure they pass before submission.

6. **Documentation**:  
   Update documentation to reflect any new features or modifications.  
   This includes README, inline comments, and relevant markdown files.

PULL REQUEST PROCESS
--------------------
1. Ensure your pull request (PR) is up-to-date with the `main` branch and resolves any merge conflicts.
2. PRs should be focused and limited to a single feature, bugfix, or improvement.
3. Link the PR to the relevant issue(s) and include a brief description of the changes.
4. Submit the PR with the appropriate label (`bugfix`, `feature`, `documentation`, etc.).
