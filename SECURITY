the issue by following these guidelines.

REPORTING VULNERABILITIES

   Your report should include:
   
      - A description of the issue
      - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
      - Any potential impact you foresee

3. **Please allow us time to respond**.  
   We will work promptly to investigate the vulnerability, confirm the report,  
   and develop any necessary patches or updates.

4. **Credit for responsible disclosure** will be given where applicable and upon request,  
   as a thank-you for helping protect the project and its users.

Upon receiving a vulnerability report, we will:

- Acknowledge receipt of your report within a reasonable timeframe.
- Provide updates on the progress of our investigation.
