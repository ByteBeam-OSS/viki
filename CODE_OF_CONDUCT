BYTEBEAM CODE OF CONDUCT
=========================

Welcome to Viki! Our project thrives on collaboration, respect, and a commitment to quality.  
This Code of Conduct aims to create a productive environment where everyone can contribute  
effectively while respecting the time and efforts of others.

COMMUNITY STANDARDS
--------------------
1. **Read the Documentation First**:  
      Before opening an issue or asking questions, ***RTFM***, including README files,  
      FAQs, and other resources (Google it! or ask your wife!). We expect contributors to make a genuine effort to understand  
      the projectâ€™s code and structure on their own.

2. **Clear, Focused Communication**:  
      When opening issues, submitting pull requests, or starting discussions, keep them clear and relevant.  
      Avoid cluttering threads with off-topic comments, vague issues, or repetitive questions.  
      Be concise and to the point.

3. **Respectful Interactions**:  
      Treat all contributors with respect and approach discussions with an open mind.  
      Productive feedback and constructive criticism are encouraged, but personal attacks,  
      rudeness, or dismissive comments will not be tolerated.

4. **Independence and Initiative**:  
      Show initiative in understanding the project and solving issues on your own whenever possible.  
      Demonstrating that you've put in effort to troubleshoot independently is appreciated and  
      helps maintain the quality of contributions.

REPORTING ISSUES
-----------------
If you encounter behavior that violates these standards, please report it by emailing connect@byte-beam.io.  
We handle reports with discretion and aim to resolve issues promptly while maintaining a positive,  
collaborative environment.
